- Proper spacing and padding for all screen sizes

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/app/api/stats/route.ts` - Aggregate statistics endpoint
- `/components/TeamRaceTracker.tsx` - Team competition display
- `/components/AthleteSearch.tsx` - Search input component
- `/components/AthleteCard.tsx` - Individual athlete card
- `/test-phase3.sh` - Testing script for Phase 3 features

### Modified Files
- `/app/page.tsx` - Complete redesign as bikeathon homepage

## üß™ Testing Results

### ‚úÖ API Endpoints Working
- `/api/stats` - Returns correct aggregate data
- `/api/teams` - Returns teams with athlete counts
- `/api/athletes` - Returns all athletes with team info

### ‚úÖ Component Integration
- Homepage loads successfully (HTTP 200)
- All components render without errors
- Client-side hydration working properly
- Search functionality filters athletes in real-time

### ‚úÖ Responsive Layout
- Grid adapts properly to screen sizes
- Mobile layout is touch-friendly
- Components scale appropriately

## üìù Technical Implementation Notes

### Key Patterns Used

1. **Client Component for Homepage:**
   - Used `'use client'` for interactivity
   - State management with useState and useEffect
   - Client-side search filtering with useMemo

2. **Data Fetching Strategy:**
   - Parallel fetch of all data on mount
   - Single loading state for entire page
   - Error handling with console logging

3. **Search Implementation:**
   - Debounced search input (300ms)
   - Case-insensitive filtering
   - Real-time results without API calls

4. **TypeScript Interfaces:**
   - Proper typing for all data structures
   - Stats, Team, and Athlete interfaces

5. **Minimal UI Approach:**
   - Simple, clean design with scaffolding focus
   - Basic Tailwind classes for styling
   - No complex animations (saved for Phase 4)

## üéØ Success Criteria Met

‚úÖ Homepage displays overall fundraising total
‚úÖ Team competition visible with simple progress bars
‚úÖ Athletes searchable by name
‚úÖ Athlete cards link to donation pages
‚úÖ Mobile-responsive layout
‚úÖ All data fetched from database
‚úÖ Real-time search works smoothly

## üöÄ Ready for Phase 4

The homepage and user experience features are fully functional with minimal UI. The foundation is solid and ready for:
- Polish and animations
- Error handling improvements
- Loading state refinements
- Performance optimizations
- Final testing and deployment

## üí° Notes for Phase 4

### Recommended Enhancements
1. Add skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
2. Implement smooth animations with framer-motion
3. Add error boundaries for resilient error handling
4. Optimize images with next/image component
5. Add meta tags for SEO
6. Implement proper loading states for each section
7. Add hover effects and micro-interactions
8. Consider adding recent donations feed

### Current State
- All athletes start at $0 raised (ready for testing donations)
- Team competition shows even distribution (all at 0%)
- Search is case-insensitive substring matching
- No pagination (works fine for 12 athletes)

The implementation follows the minimal scaffolding approach requested, focusing on functionality over visual polish.
